== DSS Messenger

Messenger is simple message sending and storage service that integrates
with DSS-RM (RightsManagement) for identity management. It also accepts
and sends messages on the behalf of applications and can be used to store
global flash messages for use in website templates.

== Deployment

Messenger is designed to be re-deployable in any organization, though there are a few matters
of configuration that need to be attended to:

config/database.yml.example
	Move this file to config/database.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/api_keys.yml.example
	Move this file to config/api_keys.yml and set the appropriate values.

config/environment.rb
	Recode the cas.ucdavis.edu URL to your CAS server, or remove CAS entirely. If you
	decide to remove CAS, also remove the before_filter in
	app/controllers/application_controller.rb.

config/deploy.rb
	You'll likely want to set this to your own Capistrano setup or delete it
	if you do not use Capistrano.
	
config/environments/*
  Messenger uses ActionMailer to do its e-mailing. Be sure to configure this to your
  liking, e.g. different SMTP, local sendmail installation, etc.

You can also search the code for "INSTALLME" (case-sensitive) in case this README
is out of date.

== Technical Notes
By default, the Flash API query only looks a week ahead.

== Security Notes
As of the current version, there is only the "admin" role, which can read all messages,
including those meant for other people. The api/ module acts the same way. If this is
to be altered in the future, one must not forget to alter the api/ module's disparate
behavior as well as the HTML view's behavior.
